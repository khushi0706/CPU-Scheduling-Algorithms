# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of six CPU scheduling algorithms in a menu-driven code: FCFS, SJF, SRTF, Round Robin, Non-Preemptive Priority and Preemptive Priority.

## Algorithms
### FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
* The First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) algorithm schedules processes in the order in which they arrive in the ready queue.

### SJF (Shortest Job First)
* The Shortest Job First (SJF) algorithm schedules the process with the smallest execution time next.

### SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
* The Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) algorithm is a preemptive version of the SJF algorithm. It schedules the process with the smallest remaining execution time next.

### Round Robin
* The Round Robin algorithm schedules processes in a cyclic order, where each process is executed for a fixed amount of time, known as a time slice or quantum.

### Non-Preemptive Priority
* The Non-Preemptive Priority algorithm schedules processes based on their priority, where the process with the highest priority is executed first. If two processes have the same priority, FCFS scheduling is used.

### Preemptive Priority
* The Preemptive Priority algorithm is a preemptive version of the Non-Preemptive Priority algorithm. It schedules processes based on their priority, where the process with the highest priority is executed first. If two processes have the same priority, the one with the smaller execution time is executed first.<br><br>
